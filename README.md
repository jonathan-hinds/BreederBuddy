1. Open your palbox and organize it so there are no empty spaces.

(Just a heads-up: our scanner commits to scanning the entire page before recognizing it's hit a gap. So, if you notice it breezing past empty spaces, don't fret! It's just that it won't know it's time to stop until it's done with the page it's currently on. This setup is perfect for scanning specific sections if you arrange a little space at the end of a page where you'd like the scanning to halt).

2. Launch the app above the game and press the scan button.

(You have a quick 5 seconds to switch back to the game window, essential for the scanner to do its magic with page switching.)

3. Hang tight and avoid using the mouse during the scan.

(We'll be commandeering your mouse to explore your palbox for those elusive passive traits.)

4. Once the scanning concludes, the app window come back into focus. 

(Just remember, keep your hands off the mouse until this enchanting moment occurs.)
